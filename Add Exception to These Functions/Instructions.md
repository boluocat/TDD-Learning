We will once again be making modifications to compute_stats_refactor.py. 

In order to gain more experience with exception handling and to make our script less prone to errors we will be adding try/except statements to these various functions. 

- read_ints: Add try/except statement to handle the error if a user enters a file that doesnâ€™t exist 
- count: Add a try/except statement to handle the error if a user enters invalid input. 
- summation:  Add a try/except statement to handle the error if a user enters invalid input. 
- average:  Add a try/except statement to handle the error if a user enters invalid input. 
- minimum:  Add a try/except statement to handle the error if a user enters invalid input. 
- maximum:  Add a try/except statement to handle the error if a user enters invalid input. 
- harmonic_mean:  Add a try/except statement to handle the error if a user enters invalid input. 
- variance:  Add a try/except statement to handle the error if a user enters invalid input.
- standard_dev:  Add a try/except statement to handle the error if a user enters invalid input.
