Here's the instructions for the lab:
- test_default: Let's refactor the name to be more descriptive; right now it's not very expressive. Once done, fix the testing logic so it actually passes
- test_change: Again, this unit test is poorly named. Refactor it so that its name gives the meaning behind it. Once done, fix the logic so that it passes
- test_current_speed: Alas, this unit test is named nicely, but there's something terrify wrong with the unit test. What is it? Make the update
- test_accelerate: This unit test violates one of the principles for developing goog unit tests. Refactor it so that it's clean and does one job and one job only.
- test_brake: This unit test doesn't pass, fix it so that it does.
