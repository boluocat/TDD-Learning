The goal of this lab is to continue in from the example shown in the reading for this module. You can see `A step-by-step example for Red-Green-Refactor.ipynb`.

You'll be given two files:
- finance_formulas.py: Contains the implementation of the various finance formulas
- tets_finances.py: Contains the tests of the various finance formulas.

As shown in the reading you'll need to adapt the Red-Green-Refactor mantra to finishing the rest of the logic. Start out by writing the test for the `net_worth` method. Remember, it's suppose to fail, and then afterwards write the minimum logic needed to get that test to pass. Once accomplished move on to the refactoring phase, and then rinse-and-repeat for the remaining functionality.
