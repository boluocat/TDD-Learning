The goal of this lab is to develop your skills with writing unit tests. In the unit 1 folder here are several files. 

Below is a brief explanation of the files:

__init__.py: A required file

test_unittest_practice_1.py: Several unit tests for you to fill in. The unit tests in this module will test the adder function from tested_functions.py

test_unittest_practice_2.py: This is the file that will test the divider function from tested_functions.py

tested_functions.py: This is the file that contains the two functions that will be tested in the other modules which are adder and divider

In this lab the only files youâ€™ll be modifying are test_unittest_practice_1.py and test_unittest_practice_2.py.  This is where you'll be adding in the logic for your unit tests.
