    "The action -> assertion pattern and the record -> replay pattern are two different approaches to mocking and verifying interactions between components in unit tests.

    "# 1. Action -> Assertion Pattern (Used by unittest.mock)\n",
    "## How It Works:\n",
    "- In the **action -> assertion** approach, the test first **acts** (i.e., executes operations) on the system under test.\n",
    "- After the test has run, you then **assert** that the correct interactions (such as method calls, arguments, return values) occurred during the test.\n",
    "## Characteristics:\n",
    "- Explicit Expectations: The test defines the expected behavior after executing the test logic. Assertions are made on the mock objects to verify that they were used correctly.\n",
    "- Test Flow: The flow is sequential—first, you \"do\" (execute actions), then you \"check\" (assert results).\n",
    "- Flexibility: This approach is often more flexible because it allows you to focus on verifying behaviors that happen during the test, rather than having to record everything in advance.\n",
    "- Error Handling: Errors are usually caught in the assertion phase, meaning that the test may fail if expectations are violated after the actions have been performed."
